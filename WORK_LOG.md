| Aug 24 |    1-1:30    |                                     Spent the Entire Time Trying To Figure Out How to fix the compiler, and the missmatched source release and target release. I set everything to Java 21 and still cannot find out what the issue is here. |
| Aug 24 |    1:30-2    |                                                             Could not get code to compile, so started to work on first method. Have a method that I think will run the ascii values but Im not sure if they work or not, as I can't compile. |
| Aug 30 |   12-1:30    |                                                                                      Got the first Method to work. I used a string builder class which I think isin't industry standard, but it made more sense to be to edit one at a time. |
| Sept 1 |     12-2     |                                                                                       got Method two to work. it was quite similar to the first method. not too bad honestly, my biggest error was just making sure I edited the right index |
| Sept 1 |     6-9      | I got method three to work. I really like the string builder class, and it makes solving these problems easier. I first removed all the spaces, and just made two different cases, depending on if the ascii balue was three characters or 2 |
| Sept 2 | 9:30 - 10:30 |       Found the pattern, could not crack method 4, Realize in retrospect I shifted by the wrong amount, and that cause the errors that I was seeingâ€”I was off by the delta of upper and lowercase characters and my text was all upper case. |
